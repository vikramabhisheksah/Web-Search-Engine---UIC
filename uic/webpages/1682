<h2 headerid="1" name="text"><a id="a" name="a"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>The UIC School of Public Health is dedicated to excellence in protecting and improving the health and well-being of the people of the Metropolitan Chicago area, the State of Illinois, the nation, and others throughout the world. This mission is achieved by: educating scientists, professionals, and the public; conducting research to develop solutions to public health problems; providing public health service; and formulating public health policy. Ours is a community of scholars, students, and staff dedicated to creating a healthy society. Committed to academic excellence, the UIC School of Public Health fosters cutting-edge research and engaged community-based practice that focuses on eliminating health disparities and bringing public health solutions to communities in need.</p>
<p>Whether a student is a freshman at UIC, a baccalaureate degree holder looking for graduate education in public health, a seasoned professional seeking specialized public health training, or someone who simply wants to sample the field—the School of Public Health has something to offer. The UIC School of Public Health offers applicants a choice of degrees to pursue including the Bachelor of Arts in Public Health (BA), Bachelor of Science in Public Health (BS), Master of Public Health (MPH), Master of Healthcare Administration (MHA), Master of Science (MS), Master of Science in Clinical and Translational Science (MS CTS), Doctor of Public Health (DrPH), and Doctor of Philosophy in Public Health (PhD). At the undergraduate level, a Minor in Public Health is open to students in any major. Faculty and alumni continue to make solid contributions in Chicago and across the globe. Their vision, resolve, and ingenuity have built the foundation for a rich UIC public health legacy. Students learn, innovate, practice, research, and challenge public health concepts in Chicago and in communities around the world.</p>
<h2 headerid="2" name="text"><a id="b" name="b"></a>Public Health Baccalaureate Programs</h2>
<div class="page" data-loaded="true" data-page-number="29" id="bp-page-29" style="margin-left:auto">
<div class="textLayer">The School of Public Health offers two baccalaureate degree programs: the Bachelor of Arts in Public Health and the Bachelor of Science in Public Health. The Bachelor of Arts emphasizes the socio-cultural determinants of health and the associated selective course options largely align with social sciences and humanities. The Bachelor of Science positions students who plan to pursue graduate and professional degrees and careers built upon a foundation of basic and applied sciences such as epidemiology and biostatistics, dentistry, environmental and occupational health sciences, medicine, and pharmacy.</div>
<div class="textLayer"> </div>
<div class="textLayer">The mission of the baccalaureate programs in public health is to engage and enlighten students about matters related to the health of societies locally, nationally, and globally. By systematically examining biological, environmental, cultural, behavioral, historical, economic, and political factors that mitigate health, students in the program will become informed citizens who can consider the public’s health in whatever life roles they assume. For those who go on to careers in medicine, nursing, dentistry, and other health-related professions, the baccalaureate programs in public health build upon a broad foundation in the biological and behavioral sciences imbued with social ecology and population–based perspectives. Graduates of the program acquire an array of skills that can be applied to many forms of inquiry, analysis, scientific and moral reasoning, and practice. At the baccalaureate level, graduates may seek employment in public health as communicable disease investigators, public health educators, program coordinators, environmental specialists, information specialists, and other roles commensurate with their skills. Those wishing to pursue professional careers in the public health arena will be well positioned to continue their studies through matriculation into master’s degree programs in public health. Emerging from the program with an informed understanding of public health, graduates embrace the vision of health equity and social justice.</div>

Grades of B or better are preferred.</p>

<h4>Additional Course Requirements</h4>
<h5>First Year Seminar Requirement</h5>
<p>All incoming first year students to the School of Public Health as well as transfer students who enter with less than 24 semester hours earned must complete a first-year seminar, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PUBH%20105" title="PUBH 105" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PUBH 105');">PUBH 105</a></span> during their first term at UIC. Satisfactory completion of the seminar is a graduation requirement.</p>

<h5>Foreign Language (required for the Bachelor of Arts in Public Health only)</h5>
<p>Students in the Bachelor of Arts in Public Health must earn 16 hours in a single language or the equivalent. Students with a background in a foreign language may take proficiency tests, and if passed students would be able to substitute other course work for this 16-semester-hour requirement. Please see the <a href="/ucat/colleges-depts/liberal-arts-sciences/#b2">College of Liberal Arts and Sciences</a> foreign language requirement for further explanation.</p>
<p>While not required for students in the Bachelor of Science, those who have an interest in developing language competencies may opt to enroll in foreign language courses as free electives.</p>
<h3 headerid="6" name="text"><a id="b4" name="b4"></a>Other Requirements</h3>
<h4>Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement</h4>
<p>A student must earn a cumulative grade point average of 2.50/4.00 in all work taken at UIC. In addition, the combined average of a student’s transfer work and work taken at UIC must be at least 2.50. The minimum cumulative grade point average for public health major course work is 2.50.</p>
<h4>Graduation Declaration/Filing to Graduate</h4>
<p>Students declare their intent to graduate online using <em><a href="http://my.UIC.edu/" target="_blank">my.UIC.edu</a></em>. The deadline for submission to the Pending Degree List is the end of the third week (fall and spring) or second week (Summer Session 2) of the term in which graduation is sought. Failure to submit the request at this time may delay the awarding of the degree. A final review will be made following the close of the term. If a student has satisfactorily completed all the degree requirements, the student’s name will be placed on the official degree list.</p>
<h4>Enrollment Residence Requirement</h4>
<p>See the <em><a href="/ucat/degree-programs/univ-degree-requirements-graduation/">University Degree Requirements, Graduation, and Commencement</a></em> section of the catalog for a complete description of this requirement.</p>
<h4>Transfer Credit</h4>
<p>Course work completed at other colleges and universities may apply toward partial fulfillment of graduation requirements and may be used as prerequisites for courses at UIC. The University of Illinois Chicago is a participant in the Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI), a statewide agreement that allows for the transfer of the IAI-approved General Education Core Curriculum between participating institutions. Please consult the <em>Illinois Articulation Initiative</em> in the <em><a href="/ucat/admissions-registration-finances/admissions/">Admissions</a></em> section of the undergraduate catalog. The final decision, however, regarding the acceptance of credit and courses that apply toward degree requirements is made by the School of Public Health.</p>
<h4>Transfer Credit for Continuing Students</h4>
<p>Continuing students who want to take course work for credit at another institution, either concurrent with UIC enrollment or during the summer term, must obtain prior written approval from the School of Public Health. Students will have to provide justification for the request.</p>
<p>If prior approval is not obtained from the school, credit may not be allowed. Students are obligated to report all work from other institutions once enrolled at UIC.</p>
<p>Please note that when transferring credit from a community college, a student must earn at least 60 of the required semester hours either at the University of Illinois Chicago or another accredited four-year college or university. The enrollment residence requirements must also be met. Thus, students ordinarily should not register at a community college after completing their sophomore year.</p>

<h2 headerid="8" name="text"><a id="c" name="c"></a>School of Public Health Policies</h2>
<h3 headerid="9" name="text"><a id="c1" name="c1"></a>Academic Load</h3>
<p>In the School of Public Health, while full-time student status is preferred, students may enroll in a part-time program of study. During the fall and spring semesters, a minimum full-time program is 12 hours of credit per semester. A program of 19 semester hours or more must be approved by the Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Public Health. For Summer Session 1 (four-week) and Summer Session 2 (eight-week), UIC considers a total aggregate of 6 semester hours as the minimum number necessary to constitute full-time enrollment. A program of 13 semester hours or more during the summer session must be approved by the Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Public Health.</p>
<h3 headerid="10" name="text"><a id="c2" name="c2"></a>Academic Probation and Dismissal Rules</h3>
<p>A student will be placed on academic probation in any term in which either a cumulative or semester grade point average of less than 2.50/4.00 is earned for all academic work or when the cumulative grade point average for required public health courses falls below 2.50. A student on probation is expected to earn greater than a 2.50 in the next term and have an overall UIC cumulative grade point average of 2.50 by the end of the second term on probation.</p>
<h4>Dismissal Rules</h4>
<p>Students failing to earn a cumulative grade point average of 2.50 by the end of two terms on probation will be dismissed from the university. In any term, a student may be dismissed for one or more of the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
	<li>First-term students will be dismissed after their first term of enrollment if they earn zero credit or obtain a deficit of -15 points or more. Deficit points are calculated as follows: multiply the number of credit hours for each course taken by the points for the grade received, A=+2, B=+1, C=0, D=-1, F=-2. Add the points of each course taken during the semester. The total equals the deficit points used to determine probation status. Each deficit point equals one hour of B.</li>
	<li>Continuing students will be dismissed at the end of any term in which their cumulative deficit points (see above) are -15 or more.</li>
	<li>Failure to earn any credit.</li>
	<li>Failure to earn at least a 1.00/4.00 (D) average for a term.</li>
	<li>Failure to earn at least a 2.50/4.00 while on probation.</li>
	<li>Failure to meet conditions of probation.</li>
	<li>Failure to meet conditions specified at the time of admission.</li>
	<li>Failure to make progress toward completion of the Public Health degree.</li>
	<li>Two or more consecutive terms of university withdrawals.</li>
</ol>
<p>The dean may waive the dismissal rules in extraordinary circumstances.</p>
<h4>Appeal of a Dismissal Decision</h4>
<p>Students who have been dismissed by the school may apply for readmission after two terms (excluding the summer session). Students who can document that poor academic performance was the result of significant extenuating circumstances, such as a long-term or debilitating illness or personal crisis, may petition for immediate reinstatement. The student must make arrangements for an interview, with supporting documentation, with the Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Public Health or a school dean prior to the first day of instruction of the new term.</p>
<h3 headerid="11" name="text"><a id="c3" name="c3"></a>Change of Course Schedule—Dropping Courses</h3>
<p>Undergraduate students may drop courses using <em><a href="http://my.UIC.edu/" target="_blank">my.UIC.edu</a></em> through the end of the second week of classes for fall and spring semesters, the first Wednesday of Summer Session 1, or the first Friday of Summer Session 2. During weeks 3 through 10 of the fall and spring semesters (first Thursday through the third Wednesday of Summer Session 1 or weeks 2 through 5 of Summer Session 2), students may drop courses with the permission of their major college. If the drop occurs between 0 and 2 weeks in fall and spring, there will be no notation on the transcript. If the drop occurs during weeks 3 through 10 in fall and spring (first Thursday through the second Wednesday of Summer Session 1 or weeks 2 through 5 of Summer Session 2), a W is noted on the transcript. Undergraduate students may drop a maximum of 4 UIC individual courses that result in a W notation on their transcript during their entire undergraduate degree program.</p>
<h3 headerid="12" name="text"><a id="c4" name="c4"></a>Class Attendance</h3>
<p>Each instructor may establish his/her own attendance policy, including penalties for nonattendance. Failure to attend classes does not result in automatic withdrawal from a course. The school expects that students will attend all classes.</p>
<h3 headerid="13" name="text"><a id="c5" name="c5"></a>Course Prerequisites</h3>
<p>A student must satisfy the prerequisites before enrolling in a course. A student enrolling in a course without having met the prerequisites may be withdrawn from the course. Course prerequisites are listed in both the course descriptions in this catalog and the <em>Schedule of Classes</em>. Only the instructor may waive the prerequisite, if given evidence that the student is adequately prepared to pursue the subject.</p>
<h3 headerid="14" name="text"><a id="c6" name="c6"></a>Credit/No Credit Option</h3>
<p>The credit/no credit option allows the student to complete a course with a grade of credit (CR) or no credit (NC) instead of a letter grade. Courses completed with a grade of CR carry credit and apply toward degree requirements. In general, grades of CR and NC are final and cannot be changed to letter grades. The Public Health program’s policy coincides with campus policy with the following conditions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Only students in good standing may elect to take a course under the credit/no credit option. Students on probation and those whose status is undetermined at the time at which they elect the option are not eligible.</li>
	<li>A student may request only one course per term as credit/no credit.</li>
	<li>No more than two courses in a single discipline may be taken as credit/no credit.</li>
	<li>Only elective courses may be taken on a credit/no credit basis; courses being used to meet any graduation course requirements must be taken for letter grades.</li>
	<li>The following describes the restrictions that apply to all students regardless of major or curriculum:
	<ol>
		<li>Students may not take <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ENGL%20160" title="ENGL 160" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ENGL 160');">ENGL 160</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=ENGL%20161" title="ENGL 161" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'ENGL 161');">ENGL 161</a></span> as credit/no credit.</li>

		<li>Students may not take any course used to satisfy the foreign language requirement as credit/no credit.</li>
		<li>Students may not take any course used to satisfy the General Education Core requirements as credit/no credit. Until students have completed the minimum requirement in each General Education Core category, courses from these areas may not be taken as credit/no credit.</li>
		<li>Students may not take any course used to satisfy the quantitative reasoning requirement as credit/no credit.</li>
		<li>Students may not take any course being used to satisfy the requirements of the Public Health major or required prerequisite and collateral courses of the major as credit/no credit.</li>
	</ol>

	</li>

	<li>A student may earn no more than 21 semester hours of credit at UIC under the credit/no credit option.</li>
</ol>

<p>Students must apply to take a course credit/no credit at the School of Public Health Undergraduate Program office no later than the tenth day of the term (first Wednesday of Summer Session 1 or first Friday of Summer Session 2). After that date, students may not request courses on a credit/no credit basis nor may they change a credit/no credit request previously submitted. It is the responsibility of the student to determine eligibility under the regulations. Students will be informed if they are ineligible and will receive a grade for the course. Students with questions concerning their eligibility should make an appointment with their academic advisor.</p>
<h3 headerid="15" name="text"><a id="c7" name="c7"></a>Double Major, Double Degrees, and Second Bachelor’s Degree</h3>
<h4>Double Major</h4>
<p>This option is not available in the School of Public Health at this time.</p>
<h4>Double Degrees</h4>
<p>Double degrees consist of two bachelor’s degrees completed concurrently. Double degrees with a School of Public Health bachelor's degree program and a program in another college may be possible. Students should consult the college section of the catalog for the second degree program to determine if this option is available.</p>
<p>Students seeking two bachelor’s degrees concurrently must formally request acceptance into the second degree program. Students must complete a minimum of 30 semester hours beyond those required for the first degree and all requirements for each of the degree programs as specified by the college and major department. All students interested in double degrees should discuss this option with an advisor.</p>
<p>Double degrees are not permitted when there is substantial course overlap between the first and second degrees.</p>
<p>Students who obtain double degrees receive a diploma for each degree. No more than two bachelor’s degrees may be awarded concurrently.</p>
<h4>Second Bachelor’s Degree</h4>
<p>Students who have already earned a bachelor’s degree at UIC or another institution are required to follow the same application procedures as all other applicants in order to pursue a second bachelor’s degree. Students must complete all requirements for the second degree as specified by the college and the major department, including a minimum of 30 semester hours beyond those required for the first degree. The UIC enrollment residence requirement must also be met, i.e., the last 30 semester hours for the second degree must be taken at UIC. A second bachelor’s degree is not permitted when there is substantial course overlap between the first and second degrees.</p>
<h3 headerid="16" name="text"><a id="c8" name="c8"></a>Graduate-Level Courses for Undergraduate Students</h3>
<p>With approval from the Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Public Health and permission from the professor, an undergraduate student may enroll in a course at the graduate level (400- or 500-level) for undergraduate credit. Prior to enrollment, students must obtain approval and must have met course prerequisites.</p>
<p>Students should understand that graduate-level courses taken by an undergraduate student are generally not applicable toward a graduate degree.</p>
<h3 headerid="17" name="text"><a id="c9" name="c9"></a>Independent Study</h3>
<p>To be eligible to enroll in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=PUBH%20396" title="PUBH 396" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'PUBH 396');">PUBH 396</a></span>, a student must have a minimum 2.50/4.00 grade point average in all course work taken at UIC and must obtain consent of the instructor and the Undergraduate Public Health program prior to registration. No student may enroll in an independent study course after the tenth day of the term without approval of the Undergraduate Public Health program.</p>

<h3 headerid="18" name="text"><a id="c10" name="c10"></a>Petition Procedure</h3>
<p>Any rule, regulation, or action of the Undergraduate Public Health program may be appealed in writing. Petitions are submitted to the Undergraduate Program Office in the School of Public Health. It is the student’s responsibility to provide documentation in support of the petition. Submission of a petition does not imply approval.</p>
<h3 headerid="19" name="text"><a id="c11" name="c11"></a>Registration Approval</h3>
<p>All new students are required to attend an orientation program prior to registration. Certain students or groups of students may be required to see an advisor prior to registration.</p>
<h3 headerid="20" name="text"><a id="c12" name="c12"></a>Repeat Policy for Standard Graded Courses</h3>
<p>Students may repeat a course to increase their knowledge of the subject matter. There are circumstances under which repeating a course is advisable and to a student’s advantage. There are also circumstances where repeating a course may disadvantage a student and narrow a student’s options. The Public Health program requires students to discuss any plan to repeat a course with their academic advisor before they register to repeat the course.</p>
<p>Courses with A or B grades may not be repeated. Normally, courses with a C grade may not be repeated. Courses with D or F grades may be repeated once without written permission. In all cases, the original grade for the course and the grade for each repeat will appear on the transcript. The original grade and the grade for each repeat will be calculated into the grade point average. Only one registration for the course counts toward the total number of credits required for graduation. A course cannot be repeated after receiving credit in a course for which the repeat course is a prerequisite.</p>
<p>To repeat a course more than once due to a grade of D or F requires written permission from the student’s college dean. Students who have been dismissed may not appeal on the grounds of intention to repeat courses. Certain courses may not be repeated; students should consult their college before repeating a course.</p>
<h4><strong>Undergraduate Grade Point Average Recalculation Policy</strong></h4>
<ul>
	<li>Colleges may elect to implement this policy as early as the end of the junior year, or as late as the final semester during degree certification.</li>
	<li>The college will evaluate each student unable to graduate because of an academic grade point average deficit. The deficit may occur in the UIC GPA, the program GPA, or both.</li>
	<li>The academic record is examined so as to determine if courses, deemed appropriate by each college, with grades of F or grades of D, may be excluded from the student’s grade point average.</li>
	<li>A total of four courses may be excluded, with one course excluded at a time until the necessary quality points are obtained to meet the UIC GPA requirement and/or degree program minimum GPA. The credit hours associated with excluded course grades will not count towards graduation requirements.</li>
	<li>Only the college can initiate course exclusions, and only in consultation with the evaluated student.</li>
	<li>Students may not request exclusions.</li>
	<li>Only courses taken at UIC may be converted as part of this policy.</li>
	<li>This policy only applies to undergraduate degree seeking students.</li>
	<li>All courses taken and all grades will remain on the official transcript.</li>
	<li>The grade exclusion policy does not apply to courses failed as the result of a student conduct hearing.</li>
	<li>In cases where these procedures would impact program accreditation, licensure or similar, colleges may use their discretion to allow the policy. Colleges, departments, and programs may have discretion in choosing courses that impact the student’s major.</li>
</ul>
<h3 headerid="21" name="text"><a id="c13" name="c13"></a>Transferring</h3>
<h4>Intercollege Transfer Students</h4>
<p>Students currently enrolled at UIC who want to transfer into the School of Public Health should complete an Intercollege Transfer Application available on the School of Public Health website. Direct admission to the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science in Public Health program is offered for the fall semester only. Students currently enrolled at UIC who have not yet completed the specified general education course work necessary for direct admission to the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science in Public Health program are eligible to apply to the Public Health–Undecided (Pre-Public Health) program within the School of Public Health. Admission to Public Health–Undecided (Pre-Public Health) is offered each semester. Application deadlines are available on the School of Public Health website. Admission to the School of Public Health is selective and limited to those students in good academic standing who have a UIC grade point average of at least 2.50/4.00 and whose combined UIC and transfer grade point average is at least 2.50. A 2.75/4.00 or above is recommended for priority consideration. Those students who are accepted into the School of Public Health are expected to enroll immediately in courses that fulfill the Public Health degree requirements. Students are welcome to discuss the School of Public Health admissions process with program staff.</p>
<h4>Transfer Students from Other Colleges and Universities</h4>
<p>New transfer applicants seeking direct admission to the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science in Public Health program must have completed at least 60 semester hours of specified General Education course work. New transfer applicants who have completed a minimum of 24 semester hours of transferable college course work at the time of application but have not yet completed the specified general education course work necessary for direct admission to the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science in Public Health programs are eligible to apply to the Public Health–Undecided (Pre-Public Health) program within the School of Public Health. All applicants must submit complete transcripts from all postsecondary institutions. Provided space is available, a minimum 2.50/4.00 grade point average is required for consideration. A 2.75/4.00 or above is recommended for priority consideration. Please consult the <em><a href="/ucat/admissions-registration-finances/admissions/" target="_blank">Admissions</a></em> section of the catalog for more information. See the Office of Admission <a href="https://admissions.uic.edu/undergraduate/undergraduate-requirements-deadlines/transfer-requirements/transfer" target="_blank">Transfer Guide</a> for more information about transfer admission requirements.</p>
