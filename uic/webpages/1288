<p>The Department of Kinesiology and Nutrition offers programs leading to the Bachelor of Science degree in either Kinesiology or Nutrition.</p>
<p>The Bachelor of Science in Nutrition offers the following options:<strong> </strong><span>Coordinated Program or </span><span>Nutrition Science.</span></p>
<h2>BS in Kinesiology</h2>
<p><span>The undergraduate program in kinesiology offers a common core in the foundations of kinesiology (human structure, function, and movement) with elective options preparing students for immediate employment or advanced study in numerous areas of the health sciences. In addition to the science of kinesiology, the program emphasizes competencies such as critical thinking and reasoning, communication, professionalism, and leadership, equipping graduates with important and transferable employment skills.</span></p>
<p>Kinesiology courses are taught by nationally and globally recognized leaders in their areas of teaching, research, and service who emphasize translating science into practice through hands-on learning, independent study, and experiential learning. Through this combined basic science learning with practical application of scientific principles, students are prepared for careers in a variety of health-related fields such as health and wellness coaching, health-related business operations or sales, personal training, and strength and conditioning. Our graduates also have a strong foundation and necessary prerequisites to pursue further schooling in health-related fields such as athletic training, cardiac rehabilitation, dentistry, medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, physical therapy, sport and exercise psychology, research, and more. </p>
<h3>Transfer Admission Requirements</h3>
<p>Students seeking admission to the department as a transfer student must meet the entrance requirements that are specified for transfer students. The minimum recommended transfer grade point average for admission is 2.50/4.00. No more than 60 semester hours (90 quarter hours) of credit may be accepted as transfer work from a two-year college. Complete transcripts from all postsecondary institutions must be submitted in order to be considered for admission. See the Office of Admission <a href="https://admissions.uic.edu/undergraduate/undergraduate-requirements-deadlines/transfer-requirements/transfer" target="_blank">Transfer Guide</a> for more information about transfer admission requirements.</p>
<h2>BS in Nutrition</h2>
<p><span>The Nutrition Science program, an accredited Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD), provides students with the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) required didactic course work. Upon completion of the Nutrition Science Program, students are eligible to apply for an accredited dietetic internship at another institution. After successfully completing a dietetic internship, students are eligible to sit for the Registration Examination for Dietitians. This program is also intended for students who do not wish to become registered dietitians, but instead plan to pursue advanced degrees in nutritional sciences, public health, allied health, or a professional degree in medicine.</span></p>
<p>The Nutrition Science concentration prepares students for a future career as a registered dietitian, as well as for graduate study in nutrition, medicine, public health, other allied health fields, and dentistry.</p>
<p>The Nutrition Science program is an accredited Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD), providing students with the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) required didactic course work. Upon completion of the Nutrition Science program, students are eligible to apply for an accredited dietetic internship at another institution. After successfully completing a dietetic internship, students are eligible to sit for the Registration Examination for Dietitians.</p>
<p>Dietitians provide nutritional care to people in health and disease throughout the life cycle in accordance with their nutritional requirements and food habits. Dietitians’ activities include the provision of direct inpatient and outpatient services as well as community program planning and evaluation, clinical protocol development, food service management, and research. Therefore, a dietitian must be knowledgeable in the biological and physical sciences, psychology, sociology, education, and management and must have expertise in food habits, food composition, food service, science of food and nutrition, energy and nutrient needs, program development and evaluation, and research methods. Dietitians counsel clients, as well as work with other members of the healthcare team in providing nutritional care in the clinical setting, and work with consumers in wellness programs and community agencies. Management of personnel, budgets, food operations, and consumer-oriented services in the food or healthcare industry are other areas for dietitians. The research and teaching is focused on the sciences of nutrition, physiology, biochemistry, and molecular biology and the application of knowledge in these disciplines to the maintenance of health and well-being of humans throughout their lives. The curriculum offers a wide range of courses on the nutritional, epidemiological, and behavioral aspects of human diseases, a broad perspective on human biology (including cultural factors), and a strong clinical orientation.</p>
<p>The Nutrition Science program is currently granted initial accreditation by The Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics as a Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD).</p>

<h3>First Year Admission</h3>
<p>New first year applicants interested in pursuing the Bachelor of Science in Nutrition are eligible to apply to the Nutrition Science program (concentration) through the Department of Kinesiology and Nutrition. Students must meet the general UIC entrance requirements. A high school curriculum that emphasizes math and the natural sciences (biology, anatomy and physiology, chemistry and physics) gives the student the best chance for success in nutrition. The program will accept UIC and non-UIC transfer students. Prerequisites for ACEND accredited program, such as DPD or CP, may complete their prerequisite at UIC as Nutrition Science majors.</p>
<h3>Transfer Admission Requirements</h3>
<p>Students seeking admission to the Bachelor of Science in Nutrition, Nutrition Sciences program (concentration) must meet the minimum GPA of 2.50/4.00; however, admission is not guaranteed and transfer requests will be considered on an individual basis. </p>
<p>Students seeking admission to the Bachelor of Science in Nutrition, Coordinated Program (concentration) must meet these minimum requirements:</p>
<ul>
	<li>65 semester or 97.5 quarter hours of acceptable academic credit</li>
	<li>Minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.50/4.00 (However, currently the average GPA of students accepted into the Coordinated Program is 3.60/4.00, while the average GPA of students accepted into the Nutrition Science program is 3.40/4.00.)</li>
	<li>Successful completion of the required prerequisite courses</li>
</ul>
<p>The applicant’s personal characteristics, motivation, academic background, and work experiences are factors evaluated in selecting candidates for admission into the Coordinated Program through recommendations as well as written and face-to-face interviews.</p>
<p>See the Office of Admission <a href="https://admissions.uic.edu/undergraduate/undergraduate-requirements-deadlines/transfer-requirements/transfer" target="_blank">Transfer Guide</a> for more information about transfer admission requirements.</p>
<h2>Distinction</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Distinction:</strong> 3.75 to 3.89 UIC GPA</li>
	<li><strong>High Distinction:</strong> 3.90 or above UIC GPA</li>
</ul>
<h2>Undergraduate Experiential Learning</h2>
<p>Undergraduate students are required to participate in Experiential Learning. A guided research project, independent study, undergraduate teaching experience, internship, or study abroad course can be one of the most valuable experiences of a college education. The Department of Kinesiology and Nutrition offers the following opportunities:</p>
<h3>Special Project and Presentation</h3>
<p><span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=KN%20396" title="KN 396" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'KN 396');">KN 396</a></span> is designed to be a flexible course allowing juniors and seniors to gain experience in special projects in Kinesiology-related areas. Taken for 1–3 hours, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=KN%20396" title="KN 396" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'KN 396');">KN 396</a></span> requires close interaction with one or more faculty members over the course of one semester. Students will have the opportunity to present their work in <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=KN%20397" title="KN 397" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'KN 397');">KN 397</a></span>.</p>

<h3>Internship Opportunity</h3>
<p>Students with Junior or Senior standing who have an interest in expanding their classroom learning experience into a professional career environment are encouraged to apply for the Internship Program (<span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=KN%20393" title="KN 393" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'KN 393');">KN 393</a></span>). Over the course of the semester, each student is required to obtain a minimum of 300 hours of hands-on learning at their designated internship site, earning 6 credit hours for the semester. A wide variety of internship opportunities within and outside of the Chicagoland area are available, and are designed to meet the specific career interests of each student. Students should inquire about the internship application process one to two semesters prior to the term during which they would like to intern.</p>

<h3>Undergraduate Research and Presentation</h3>
<p>The Undergraduate Research and Research Presentation sequence is offered as a capstone experience to students interested in pursuing advanced study or research careers in many subdisciplines of Kinesiology. Students complete the two-semester sequence by taking <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=KN%20398" title="KN 398" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'KN 398');">KN 398</a></span> and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=KN%20399" title="KN 399" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'KN 399');">KN 399</a></span>. Typically, the first semester is devoted to developing a topic, obtaining any necessary approvals for the study (e.g., Institutional Review Board), and collecting data. The second semester consists of continued implementation of the project, writing, and presenting the results. Students can earn up to four semester hours of graduation credit. All Undergraduate Research experiences require a faculty mentor.</p>

<h3>Helen Barton Summer Research Scholarship</h3>
<p>Promising students of sophomore standing or above who have demonstrated an interest in the research of Kinesiology faculty may apply to receive a Helen Barton Summer Research Scholarship. Recipients of the award will work closely with a faculty member in a Kinesiology laboratory on a project designed by the student and faculty member. Depending on the length and nature of the research experience, the scholarship recipient may have an opportunity to earn graduate credit. If the student and faculty member desire, the work accomplished during this experience may be later developed into the student’s Undergraduate Research and Research Presentation capstone experience.</p>
<h3><strong>Study Abroad </strong></h3>
<p>The Department of Kinesiology and Nutrition offers the opportunities to study abroad. These programs do not interrupt enrollment residence and with department and college approval, students may apply credit earned in the program toward the degree. More detailed information on these programs is available from the individual department. Extensive study abroad opportunities are offered by the UIC Study Abroad Office. For more information, please visit the <a href="http://studyabroad.uic.edu" target="_blank">Study Abroad website</a>.</p>
<h3>Undergraduate Teaching Assistant</h3>
<p>Each semester, undergraduate students have the opportunity to apply to be an undergraduate teaching assistant (UTA) for a selection of courses in Kinesiology. This is an excellent opportunity to enhance instructional skills and knowledge in areas where students have performed well.  UTAs serve as true assistants to the faculty member leading the course and their peers. If selected to be an UTA, the student will obtain credit for participating and register for <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=KN%20493" title="KN 493" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, 'KN 493');">KN 493</a></span>.</p>

<h2>Professional Certifications</h2>
<p>Courses have been developed to assist students in becoming certified as health and fitness professionals by organizations such as the American College of Sports Medicine, National Strength and Conditioning Association, National Academy of Sports Medicine, and the American Council on Exercise. For specific information on certification pathways, please speak with Kinesiology faculty and advisors as well as see each organization’s website.</p></div><!--end #textcontainer -->
