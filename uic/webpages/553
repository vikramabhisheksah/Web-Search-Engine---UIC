<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Department of Curriculum and Instruction in the College of Education (COE) offers a program leading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts in Urban Education. The BA program leads to a State of Illinois Professional Educator License (PEL) in Elementary Education (Grades 1–6). The BA program also offers the Middle Grades Endorsement (Grades 5–8) in different disciplines as additional endorsements for the initial PEL.</p>
<p>The program is committed to preparing high-quality educators for urban neighborhood schools, in partnership with Chicago Public Schools. The program also reflects UIC’s conceptual framework: UIC educators are committed to the democratic ideal of developing the full potential of all students. They develop professional knowledge through study and critical analysis, and demonstrate effective practices consistent with their professional knowledge and ideals.</p>
<p>The BA in Urban Education program provides emerging educators the deep learning and engagement necessary to build pedagogies inclusive of all students, infused with contextual understanding of systemic oppressions in urban schooling, and founded upon principles of equity and justice. </p>
<p>The BA in Urban Education provides the opportunity for students to become teachers for elementary school settings and earn a Grades 1–6, Elementary Education teaching license with the option of adding any of four middle grade (5–8) endorsements, as well as subsequent others. BA Teacher Candidates (TCs) are expected to develop the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>a deep understanding of school inequities  and community knowledges;</li>
	<li>a personal investment to children's learning in undersupported schools; and</li>
	<li>a commitment to critical self-reflection and inquiry into learning and teaching.</li>
</ol>
<p>These expectations are largely developed by having TCs conduct their student teaching in partner public schools with whom faculty have professional, scholarly, and philosophical connections. The schools working in partnership with the BA in Urban Education Program serve as sites for ongoing collaborations in development of curricula, pedagogical practices, and urban education scholarship.</p>
<h2>Admissions Requirements</h2>
<p>The BA in Urban Education program has adopted the university’s admissions requirements as listed in the <a href="/ucat/admissions-registration-finances/admissions/"><em>Admissions</em></a> section of the catalog under <em>First Year Applicant </em>and adheres to the campus policy on transfer students.</p>
<p>All freshmen and sophomores will initially be admitted to the BA in Urban Education major in the College of Education and complete the Urban Education Core Curriculum. Students must complete the 58-hour Urban Education Core Curriculum required for admission to the last two years of Elementary Education concentration. All students must maintain a GPA of 2.50/4.00 to remain in good standing during the first two years of the program. Students should complete Core Curriculum course work in four years or fewer. When students complete the Urban Education Core Curriculum, they must apply for candidacy - the state designation of students prepared to embark on intense and field-based professional course work. In addition, courses required for licensure cannot be taken for the credit/no credit and/or pass/fail option.</p>
<h2>Candidacy</h2>
<p>Students in good standing may obtain an application for candidacy to the Elementary Education concentration in the semester during which they complete the Urban Education core curriculum requirements. In addition to remaining in good standing, students who wish to become candidates in the Elementary Education concentration must:</p>
<ul>
	<li>complete 50 service learning hours working with a diverse group of students in an urban educational setting;</li>
	<li>maintain both a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.50/4.00 and a GPA of 2.50/4.00 across eight courses in core content areas (English, mathematics, science, and social studies) at the time of application. Courses, including courses in the content areas, in which a student receives a grade lower than a C will not be applied to the licensure requirements.</li>
	<li>complete preprofessional trainings and approval processes for entry into fieldwork-based courses and practica.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a student is accepted for candidacy in the EE concentration, s/he formally becomes a candidate for teacher licensure.</p>
<h2>Student Teaching—Senior Year</h2>
<p>In order to qualify for entry into student teaching, a Teacher Candidate (TC) must maintain an overall GPA of 2.50/4.00 and a minimum 3.00/4.00 for professional education courses. Courses in which a student receives a grade lower than a C will not be applied to licensure requirements. Required courses cannot be taken for the credit/no credit and/or pass/fail option. Students must also pass the Illinois State Content Test in their area of endorsement prior to student teaching. TCs will student teach in the senior year. The TC should have completed all fieldwork leading to student teaching with satisfactory progress. TCs will conduct all of their student teaching practica in urban sites with which program faculty have had long-standing partnerships. In these partnerships, program faculty have identified school leaders and teachers who have a deep understanding and commitment to the families and communities that they serve.</p></div><!--end #textcontainer -->
