<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The UIC Honors College provides an environment for advanced academic growth, creative engagement, and a foundation for lifelong learning in the dynamic, urban environment that is the great city of Chicago – bringing together a diverse group of exceptional undergraduate students, faculty, and staff.</p>
<p>Each term, Honors College students are required to complete an honors activity, which enriches their experiences at UIC.  Honors units are earned for each honors activity. Students who enter the Honors College as first year students must earn 18 Honors units; this is prorated for students who transfer into the Honors College after the first year. Students must also maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.40/4.00.</p>
<p>First year students enroll in an interdisciplinary honors core course each semester, which completes the honors activity requirement and fulfills university general education requirements. These courses are taught by faculty members from various departments and address significant themes while providing a challenging and intimate learning experience for Honors first year students. In addition, freshmen may opt to take additional honors courses in a wide range of subjects such as classics, economics, art history, chemistry, and so forth.</p>
<p>Beyond the first year, students choose from a variety of honors activity options. These include honors courses, honors seminars in a broad range of disciplines, independent research projects, tutoring in the college peer tutoring program, honors projects in regular courses, and academic service learning. All students are required to complete an honors capstone project before graduation. All of these activities are monitored within a faculty advising/mentoring system that is one of the college’s major strengths.</p>
<p>At the end of the first year, students are assigned to an Honors College fellow, who is a mentor in the student’s major department. The fellows, faculty interested in working with honors students, include many of UIC’s outstanding scholars. They act as advisors for students’ honors work and as resources for advice and guidance on students’ majors, curricula, preparation for graduate school, and careers. The Honors College fellow mentoring process puts students into close and continuing contact with faculty members at an early stage in their postsecondary education.</p>
<p>The Honors College provides merit- and need-based scholarship opportunities for beginning first year students and transfer students. Also, the college offers financial support to honors students pursuing research or international study.  The college also offers tuition awards to its continuing student body; these scholarships are distributed based on a combination of merit and need. Other scholarship support for continuing Honors College students is also available; consult the <a href="http://www.honors.uic.edu" target="_blank">college website</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Honors College students appreciate the availability of facilities reserved exclusively for their use, including a computer lab, social and study lounges, and photocopying facilities. They also enjoy events, such as student-faculty luncheons, monthly socials, and the annual Honors College Ball. Honors College students produce a college newsletter (Ampersand), and a number of other publications, including an undergraduate literary journal (Red Shoes Review), pre-health professions journal (Journal of Pre-Health Affiliated Students), and global issues journal (UIC One World). Honors College students also receive extended library privileges.</p>
<p>UIC honors students may take advantage of specially designated honors housing. In addition to sharing living space with other Honors College students, students participate in educational and social activities designed to create a special living/learning environment and a sense of an honors residential community.</p>

Further, the society encourages high standards of conduct and character and fosters fellowship among its members. The society envisions that it will seek universal recognition of its members as lifelong intellectual leaders in pharmacy and, as a community of scholars, will instill the desire to pursue intellectual excellence and critical inquiry to advance the profession. The full collegiate membership of the society shall consist of professional (entry-level, postbaccalaureate, and nontraditional) students, graduate students, and members of the teaching staff who have been duly elected in accordance with the National Rho Chi Society Bylaws. Rho Chi invites the top 10% of the P2 class after three semesters of pharmacy course work.
